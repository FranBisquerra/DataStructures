Considerations:
	
	To implement the dis_order algorithm 6 pointers are used, building two support lists. One list for the number with a lower value and one for the numbers that are the same or have a greater value. 
	Then the lists are linked and the original list pointer re-pointed to the begining of the needed list.

	Compiling:

		gnatmake -o reorganizer.exec reorganizer.adb
